# SeaLink Travel Group - Front-end Developer code test

## Task brief

1. [View the design file in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/N24UEnrXjSiDT1GA6sNwa4/SeaLink-Travel-Group-Front-end-Developer-code-test-Interview-stage?node-id=0%3A1)
2. Using a mobile-first development approach, we'd like you to build the 'past events' component from the Figma design
3. Specs of this component:
    * Prev and next buttons change the text and image.
    * The text will come from a CMS and as such be variable in height.

## Getting the project running

1. Fork our repository to your own Github account
1. Install dependencies using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install). `cd` into the `/src` directory and run `yarn install`.
1. Once dependencies have been installed, run `yarn start` to compile SCSS and Javascript. This will actively watch for any changes you save.
1. To run a simple webpack server, in a new terminal tab from the `/src` directory run `yarn server`. The app should open at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)

## Local Development

Once you have the project running as per the steps above, you're ready to start development.

1. Our boilerplate has you started with some starter SCSS, such as colours variables and fonts – `/src/scss/app.scss`
1. `/src/js/app.js` is where you can add your custom JavaScript.
1. As mentioned above, Webpack will re-build SCSS or JS as you save changes (compiled to `/app/dist/`).
1. There are 3 images available to use, located in the `/app/images` directory.
